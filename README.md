## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will provide a list of data analytics projects and briefly describe the technology I applied in solution.



### FIFA 21 Data Cleaning and EDA Analysis 
**Code:** [`FIFA 21 Data Cleaning and EDA Analysis`](https://github.com/Eugune/PortfolioProjects/blob/master/PortfolioProjects/FIFA%2021%20Date%20Cleaning%20and%20EDA/FIFA%202021%20Dataset%20Cleaning%20Challenge%20and%20EDA.ipynb)      
**Description:** EA Sports FIFA 21 is a popular soccer video game that simulates matches. The data collected from this game can often be messy, with inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues. In this project, my focus will be on cleaning and preparing the messy FIFA 21 data for analysis using Python and Pandas. In addition, I will do analysis how the top Clubs select the talent players to form their team. By analyzing the characteristics of top clubs, I will provide recommendations for forming a potentially competitive soccer team.   
**Skills:** Correation analysis(P-value), data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization, Outlier analysis (IQR), linner regression analysis      
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scipy.    
**Results:** Provide insights on how to identify talented players and form a competitive team with a limited budget.      


### Bike Share Analysis 
**Code:** [`Bike Share Analysis`](https://www.kaggle.com/code/eugunel/google-data-analytics-capstone-case-study-1)      
**Description:** The dataset contains the bike share records for the entire year of 2021, encompassing both members and casual users. The project's objective is to distinguish the differences between members and casual users and determine the optimal strategy to convert casual users into members. The project involves the following Google Analytics steps: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. Create an interactive dashboard using Tableau.  
**Skills:** Data consolidation, data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization.      
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tableau Dashboard.    
**Results:** Review of the user bike share data in Chicago, data-based business recommendations.      

### Correlation Analysis of Movie Features
**Code:** [`Correlation Analysis Of Movie Features .ipynb`](https://github.com/Eugune/PortfolioProjects/blob/master/PortfolioProjects/Correlation%20Analysis%20of%20Movie%20Features/Correlation%20Analysis%20Of%20Movie%20Features%20.ipynb)      
**Description:** The primary objective of this project is to thoroughly analyze the dataset, identifying significant correlations among various movie features. By doing so, we aim to offer informed recommendations regarding which movie genres present promising opportunities for investment and development within the industry.    
**Skills:** missing values handling, data formatting, data extracting, data visualization, data preprocessing, detecting data anomalies, python coding, descriptive statistics, dealing with outliers, data cleaning, correlation analysis  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.         
**Results:**  Offer data-based business recommendations for the best strategy.   

### Housing Data Cleaning with SQL
**Code:** [`Dataset Cleaning with SQL.sql`](https://github.com/Eugune/PortfolioProjects/blob/master/PortfolioProjects/Housing%20Data%20Cleaning%20with%20SQL/Dataset%20Cleaning%20with%20SQL.sql)     
**Description:** The goal of this project is to practice utilizing SQL to extract, analyze, and manipulate large datasets. The focus will be on applying window functions and advanced SQL functions during the data processing, showcasing proficiency in leveraging these features for effective data manipulation and in-depth analysis.  
**Skills:** missing values handling, data formatting, data extracting, data preprocessing, detecting data anomalies,descriptive statistics, data cleaning,  
**Funcions:** UPDATE SET, ALTER TABLE, LEFT, RIGHT, CHARINDEX, CONCAT ISNULL, [UPDATE SET FROM], JOIN, LEFT JOIN PIVOT, WITH AS (CTE), MAX, CROSS APPLY ROW_NUMBER, OVER, PARTITION BY, MAX SUBSTRING, LEN, PARSENAME, DELETE,  ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMNã€‚        
**Results:**  Familiar with a wide range of SQL functions and proficient in utilizing them to manipulate and analyze data effectively. 

### Covid Exploration with SQL
**Code:** [`Covid_Exploration.sql`](https://github.com/Eugune/PortfolioProjects/blob/master/PortfolioProjects/Covid%20Exploration%20with%20SQL/Covid_Exploration.sql)    
**Description:** Combining a large COVID-19 dataset spanning from 2020 to 2023 using SQL, perform additional analysis or aggregation according to countries, deaths, vaccinations, and infection rates for each country.   
**Skills:** data formatting, data extracting, data preprocessing,descriptive statistics, data cleaning,   
**Funcions:** CTE's (similiar to Tem table (with as Under standard SQL)), Create Temporary Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions (sum, max, etc.), Creating Views, Converting Data Types (convert, cast), Data Types(nvarchar(255), float, int), NULLIF, PARTITION BY, OVER BY, LIKE, DROP TABLE IF etc,          
**Results:**  Familiar with SQL data types and proficient in performing calculations and analysis using SQL.
