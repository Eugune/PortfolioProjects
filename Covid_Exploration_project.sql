/*

Analysis of COVID Data and Exploration from 01/01/2020 to 09/27/2023

Skills used:	Joins, 
				CTE's (similiar to Tem table (with as Under standard SQL)), 
				Create Temporary Tables, 
				Windows Functions, 
				Aggregate Functions (sum, max, etc.),
				Creating Views, 
				Converting Data Types (convert, cast),
				Data Types(nvarchar(255), float, int),
				Other function( NULLIF, PARTITION BY, OVER BY, LIKE, DROP TABLE IF etc.)
